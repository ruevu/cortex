# Cortex

Knowledge graph MCP server with decision provenance. Combines a native structural code indexer with decision tracking on a unified SQLite knowledge graph, plus a 3D WebGL graph viewer. The indexer is built from CBM (originally [DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp](https://github.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp), absorbed in-tree under `internal/cbm/` on 2026-05-04).

Cortex answers the question agents can't today: **"why was this built this way?"** — not just "what does this code do."

## Installation

### As a Claude Code Plugin

```bash
claude plugin add github:kalms/cortex
```

This gives you all 18 MCP tools, 3 skills, and 2 hooks automatically.

### Manual Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kalms/cortex.git
cd cortex
npm install
```

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "src/index.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/cortex"
    }
  }
}
```

Or for a built version:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/cortex"
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the MCP server (stdio) and the 2D graph viewer at [http://localhost:3334/viewer](http://localhost:3334/viewer) (the legacy 3D viewer is at `/viewer/3d`). Port 3333 is reserved for the MCP plugin instance.

## Graph UI

Cortex emits structured events for every decision change and git commit, persists them to an append-only SQLite log at `.cortex/events.db`, and broadcasts them + derived graph mutations over a WebSocket at `ws://localhost:3333/ws`. The 2D browser viewer and activity stream (Plans B and C) will consume this stream. See [docs/architecture/graph-ui.md](docs/architecture/graph-ui.md) for the two-thread event pipeline, the WebSocket protocol, and extension recipes.

## MCP Tools (18)

### Decision Tools (8)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_decision` | Create a decision with rationale, alternatives, and governed code links |
| `update_decision` | Update decision fields (title, description, rationale, status) |
| `delete_decision` | Delete a decision and cascade-delete its edges |
| `get_decision` | Get a decision with resolved GOVERNS and REFERENCES links |
| `search_decisions` | FTS5 search over decision content, optionally scoped to a code path |
| `why_was_this_built` | Find decisions governing a code entity — walks up file/directory hierarchy |
| `link_decision` | Attach GOVERNS or REFERENCES edges to an existing decision |
| `promote_decision` | Promote a decision to team or public visibility tier |

### Code Tools — SQL (7)

These query the indexer's database directly via SQLite ATTACH (no subprocess, millisecond response):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_graph` | Find code entities by name, label, or qualified name pattern |
| `trace_path` | Trace call chains via recursive CTE (mode: calls or callers) |
| `get_code_snippet` | Read source code for a fully qualified name |
| `get_graph_schema` | List node labels and edge types with counts |
| `search_code` | Grep with graph enrichment — annotates matches with enclosing function/class |
| `list_projects` | List all indexed projects |
| `index_status` | Check if a repository is indexed |

### Code Tools — Subprocess (3)

These spawn the `bin/cortex-indexer` binary (write operations):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index_repository` | Run the 7-pass indexing pipeline |
| `detect_changes` | Map git diff to affected symbols |
| `delete_project` | Remove a project from the index |

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/search-decisions` | Find existing architectural decisions before making changes |
| `/capture-decision` | Guided workflow for recording new decisions with rationale and alternatives |
| `/explain-architecture` | Narrative explanation combining decisions, call chains, and code structure |

## Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Grep → search_code nudge | PreToolUse on Grep (code files only) | Suggests using `search_code` for graph-enriched results |
| Suggest capture | PostToolUse on git commit | Reminds agents to capture architectural decisions |

## Graph Viewer

The 3D viewer at `/viewer` renders the unified knowledge graph in WebGL using [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph).

- **Node shapes by kind:** octahedrons (decisions), cubes (references), spheres (functions/components/paths)
- **Neon color palette:** amber decisions, teal functions, mint components, grey paths, violet references
- **Edge colors by relation:** grey (CALLS/IMPORTS), amber (GOVERNS), pink (SUPERSEDES), violet (REFERENCES)
- **Interactions:** orbit rotate, Cmd+drag pan, scroll zoom, click-to-focus camera, node drag
- **Detail panel:** click a node to see metadata; connections are clickable to fly to linked nodes
- **Search & filters:** real-time text search, kind filter checkboxes
- **Mobile:** responsive bottom half-sheet panel, collapsed toolbar toggles at < 768px

## Native Indexer

Cortex builds and bundles its own structural indexer at `bin/cortex-indexer`. The indexer source lives at `internal/cbm/`, absorbed from [DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp](https://github.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp) via git subtree on 2026-05-04. `npm install` runs `scripts/build-indexer.sh` (postinstall) which compiles the indexer locally — no network download, no separate install.

The indexer writes to a SQLite database under `~/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp/` (path retained for compatibility with existing caches). Cortex discovers and ATTACHes that database read-only on startup, so code entities and decisions live in separate database files but are queried as a unified graph.

- **Discovery:** Scans `~/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp/` for a database matching the current working directory
- **WAL visibility:** Cortex sees the latest indexed data automatically — no re-attach needed
- **Zero lock contention:** the indexer writes to its file, Cortex reads it. SQLite WAL MVCC handles concurrency.

Override the database path with `CBM_DB_PATH` env var.

## Seeding Test Data

```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed.ts
```

Seeds 6 code entities, 5 decisions (with supersession + promotions), and 1 reference.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                                       # 70 tests
npm run test:watch                             # Watch mode
npx vitest run tests/graph/cbm-attach.test.ts  # Single file
```
