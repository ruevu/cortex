   * Two-axis model — no more worktree collapse
   * -------------------------------------------
   * Earlier, every worktree of a repo collapsed onto the canonical
   * main-worktree root (`mainWorktreeRoot`, `git --git-common-dir`) and
   * shared one `RepoContext`, one pair of DB handles, and one pool entry.
   * That collapse is gone for the graph/store side: `ctx.repoPath` is now
   * the checkout itself, keyed in the pool by checkout, and each worktree
   * gets its own `.cortex/db`, staging, index lock, and freshness baseline.
   * `ctx.worktreeOf` still exposes the canonical root — non-null only when
   * this checkout is a linked worktree — for callers that need repo
   * identity rather than checkout identity.
   *
   * The repo-identity axis has NOT moved: `resolveDecisionsDbPath` and
   * `legacyDecisionsDbPath` still canonicalize internally via
   * `mainWorktreeRoot`, so every worktree of a repo continues to share one
   * decisions/todos store even though it no longer shares a graph store.
   *
   * Why split them: cortex's new invariant is "one graph index per
   * checkout" (so in-flight branch/PR work indexes and reads back
   * independently) alongside the older invariant "one decisions store per
   * repo" (so a decision captured in any worktree is visible from every
   * other worktree of the same repo).

 *     throws {@link MissingRepoPathError} before the handler runs.
 *
 *   - `crossRepo: true`: handler signature `(resolver, args) => result`.
 *     The wrapper skips resolution and hands the resolver to the handler
 *     for cross-repo work (list_projects, delete_project). Schemas for
 *     crossRepo tools should NOT include `repo_path`.
 *
 *   - `allowUnindexed: true`: handler signature `(resolver, args) => result`.
 *     The wrapper still requires `repo_path` (and throws MissingRepoPathError
 *     when absent) but does NOT call `resolver.resolve` — instead it hands
 *     the resolver to the handler. Used by tools that create or populate
 *     `.cortex/db` (notably index_repository), since the resolver's default
 *     path would throw {@link RepoNotIndexedError} on the very repo this
 *     tool is meant to bring online. Handlers are expected to validate the
 *     path themselves (existsSync, git root checks) before writing.
 *
 * If you're unsure which mode you want, the default is the right answer.
 *
 * @example default mode
 *   registerTool("create_decision", schema, async (ctx, args) => {

 *
 * @example crossRepo mode
