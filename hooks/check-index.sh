# Hook: check-index (SessionStart)
#
# Goal: prevent agents from defaulting to grep/Read for code exploration
# when Cortex MCP tools are available. Fires on session start / resume /
# clear / compact via the plugin's hooks.json.
#
# Behavior:
#   1. Try to detect whether the current working directory is indexed by
#      Cortex (uses bin/cortex-indexer if available, else degrades to a
#      protocol reminder).
#   2. Emit a *specific* routing table for this project, naming the tools
#      the agent should reach for first.
#
# The hook MUST be safe to run in any cwd — including non-Cortex repos
# that happen to have this plugin installed. It never errors out; the
# worst case is an emitted reminder with no index status info.

REPO="$PWD"

# Resolve the checkout root ONCE, up front, so every downstream consumer —
# index-state detection, the sentinel, the auto-index log path, and the
# spawned index target — agrees on the same directory. This used to happen
# only inside index-state detection's own fallback, and only when a store was
# actually FOUND there: a session starting in an UNINDEXED subdirectory left
# REPO pointing at the subdirectory for the rest of the script. The auto-index
# branch below would still spawn `cortex index` correctly (`runIndexCommand`
# re-roots to the checkout via `worktreeRoot()`), but INDEX_STATE kept
# checking `<subdir>/.cortex/db` — which can never exist — so the banner never
# flipped to "indexed" and the hook re-indexed every session, forever: the
# same "re-indexing every 60 minutes forever while reading as unindexed"
# pathology `maybe_bg_index`'s old comment (retired in prefer-cortex.sh)
# described, reintroduced through a different door.
# Degrade-safe: outside a git repo (or an ancient git lacking rev-parse), this
# fails silently and REPO simply stays $PWD, unchanged from before.

FIRST — load the Cortex tool schemas, before your first code question.
If the Cortex tools reach you as bare NAMES in a deferred-tools reminder,
you cannot call them yet: there is no parameter schema, and the reflex that
fills that gap is grep. Rung 1 then costs two calls where grep costs one,
and that gradient — not preference — is what decides the next hour. Spend
the call now, once:

  ToolSearch(query="+cortex search_graph search_code get_code_snippet trace_path",
             max_results=6)

Use that keyword form, not select:<exact-name>. This plugin registers the
server as `cortex`, but an embedding host may register it under another
name, and an exact-name select matches nothing there. If the full schemas
are already in your context, skip this — it is a no-op, not a required step.

The repo is indexed by Cortex. For code exploration, prefer these MCP tools
over grep/Read:

  - search_graph(name_pattern="…")    → find functions/classes by name
  - get_code_snippet(qualified_name)  → read source for a known symbol
  - trace_path(function_name, mode="callers"|"calls")
                                       → who calls X / what X calls
  - decision({action:"why", qualified_name}) → check governing decisions
  - search_code(pattern)              → graph-augmented grep
  - get_architecture(aspects)         → project structure overview

Finding a symbol is a ladder. Go down a rung only when the rung above
came back empty:

  1. search_graph / trace_path / get_code_snippet — structure, by name.
  2. search_code(pattern="…") when (1) is empty. The graph holds named
     definitions, so a shape it carries no node for reads exactly like a
     symbol that does not exist. search_code searches the same indexed
     tree as text and still annotates each hit with its enclosing symbol.
  3. Grep/Glob/Read only for non-code files (configs, docs, JSON), or a
     regex feature search_code lacks.

An empty result is NOT a staleness signal. Staleness has its own signal:
a "⚠ cortex freshness" line on the response. Without one the graph
considers itself current, so re-indexing is unlikely to change the answer
and the fix is the next rung — not index_repository. (Best-effort, not a
guarantee: CORTEX_FRESHNESS=0 switches the signal off entirely, and the
dirty-tree check cannot see a re-edit of an already-modified file.)

After any non-trivial commit, consider:
  - decision({action:"propose"}) / decision({action:"create"}) if an architectural choice was made
  - detect_changes + index_repository to keep the graph current
