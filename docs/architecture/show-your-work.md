# Show Your Work — Presence (Slice 1) + Focus Spotlight (Slice 2a) + Stories (Slice 2b)

> Living document. Started 2026-07-23. Covers what has **shipped** — the
> live presence pipeline (slice 1), the `show` tool's `focus` spotlight
> (slice 2a), and durable **stories** (slice 2b). Network layout mode is a
> future slice of the same design; see
> [the design spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-show-your-work-design.md)
> for its shape. This doc does not describe unshipped behavior.

## Purpose

Make the agent's work *visible* in the frames viewer, three ways:

1. **Live ambient presence** (this doc, shipped) — automatic, hook-fed: what
   the agent is studying/editing streams into the viewer as avatar motion +
   frame heat. Zero agent effort.
2. **Focus spotlight** (this doc, shipped — slice 2a) — the `show` tool's
   `focus` action: the agent explicitly holds a spotlight on refs (paths,
   qns, decision/todo ids) in the viewer while explaining an area or
   previewing a change. Discretionary, agent-initiated. See
   [Focus spotlight](#focus-spotlight-slice-2a) below.
3. **Stories** (this doc, shipped — slice 2b) — the `show` tool's
   `story`/`advance`/`get`/`list`/`close`/`delete` actions: agent-curated,
   durable walkthroughs the user pages through — checkpoints, branch
   walkthroughs, blast-radius previews. See [Stories](#stories-slice-2b) below.

**Agent stance:** presence is automatic and requires no agent action —
every `Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` and a handful of Cortex read tools
stream a beacon on their own via a hook. The `show` tool is **discretionary**
— used when visual detail benefits the user, never as ceremony (see the
[`show-your-work`](../../skills/show-your-work/SKILL.md) skill, and the
`explain-architecture` skill's spotlight step). Presence and spotlight are
separate signals: using one is not a substitute for or a prerequisite of the
other.

```

1. **Hook** — `hooks/show-presence.sh`, wired as two `PostToolUse` matchers
   in `hooks/hooks.json`: one on `Read|Edit|Write|MultiEdit`, one on
   `mcp__.*cortex.*__(get_code_snippet|context_pack|search_graph|trace_path|decision)`.
   Reads the tool-call JSON from stdin, maps it to an activity + ref (table
   below), and fire-and-forgets a `curl` POST. **Degrade-safe**: missing
   `jq`, empty payload, no session id, unresolvable ref, or any network
   failure is a silent `exit 0` — the hook never blocks the agent.
2. **`POST /api/presence`** (`src/mcp-server/api.ts`) — validates the body
   against `PresencePostSchema` (`src/mcp-server/api-schemas.ts`, 16 KB
   request-body cap via `MAX_PRESENCE_BODY`), checks that `repo_path`
   resolves to a registered checkout via `resolveBeaconTarget`
   (`src/mcp-server/beacon-target.ts`) — the checkout axis first, so a linked
   worktree resolves to its own row and its own graph, then
   `canonicalRepoPath` for a subdir or an unregistered worktree — and only
   then calls `presence.emit(parsed.data, target)`. The response is
   always `{ version, accepted: boolean }` — `accepted:false` when no
   registered checkout owns the path, or when no `presence` wiring was passed to
   `startViewerServer` (never an error status), so a stray beacon from a repo
   Cortex has never indexed is dropped, not surfaced as a failure to the hook.
3. **Bus wiring** (`src/index.ts` → `src/events/show-events.ts`) — the
   `presence.emit` callback wraps the POST body into a full `Event` envelope
   via `presenceActivityEvent()`: `newUlid()` for `id`,
   `kind: "presence.activity"`, `actor: "claude"`, `created_at: Date.now()`,
   `project_id` the **resolved registry name** (not the server's
   `indexerProject` — one server serves many checkouts, so the event names the
   one it is for), and payload `{session_id, workspace, repo_path, activity,
   refs}` where `repo_path` is the resolved checkout root. It then calls
   `bus.emit(...)`. From here it's the **same** EventBus → worker
   → WS pipeline every other event kind uses (see
   [graph-ui.md](graph-ui.md#event-flow-claude-creates-a-decision)).
4. **Worker** (`src/events/worker.ts`) — `processEvent()` persists via
   `EventPersister.insert()` and calls `deriveMutations()`
   (`src/events/worker/mutation-deriver.ts`), whose `presence.activity` case
   returns `[]` unconditionally: *"Presence is telemetry, not knowledge: it
   never mutates the graph."* No `add_node`/`add_edge` mutation is ever
   produced for a presence event.
5. **Retention** — `EventPersister.reapPresence(nowMs)`
   (`src/events/worker/persister.ts`) deletes `events` rows where
   `kind LIKE 'presence.%'` older than `PRESENCE_RETENTION_MS` (24 h). Called
   once, best-effort, from the worker's `init` handler
   (`src/events/worker.ts`) — a reap failure is posted as a non-fatal
   `{ type: 'error' }` message and never blocks event processing.
6. **WS broadcast + viewer backfill** — the worker's broadcast bundle
   reaches every connected client as a `{ type: 'event' }` WS message
   (`ws-client.js`'s `onEvent`). A late-joining tab also gets recent history:
   on every `hello`, `ws-client.js` sends `{ type: 'backfill', limit }`
   (`eventBackfill: { limit: 200 }` in `CanvasHost.tsx`) and the server
   answers with `backfill_page` — **replayed on every reconnect**, so
   downstream consumers must tolerate re-delivered events (idempotent
   `noteActivity` upserts handle this; see Viewer below).

### Activity mapping (hook → payload)

| Tool matcher | `activity` | `refs[0]` source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Read` | `studied` | file path (repo-relative) | |
| `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit` | `edited` | file path (repo-relative) | |
| `mcp__*cortex*__get_code_snippet`, `context_pack`, `search_graph` | `studied` | `tool_input.qualified_name` or `.name_pattern` | |
| `mcp__*cortex*__trace_path` | `traced` | `tool_input.function_name` | |
| `mcp__*cortex*__decision` | `consulted` | `tool_input.qualified_name` / `.decision_id` / `.id` | **`action` gated to `why`\|`get` only** — any other `action` (`create`/`update`/`link`/…) exits 0 without posting. See "no-double-coverage" below. |
| anything else | — | — | hook exits 0 |

For `Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`, the hook also applies a **scope
filter**: it resolves the file's git root via `git rev-parse
--show-toplevel` and drops the beacon (`exit 0`) if the file falls outside
that root — a file edited in an unrelated repo, `~/.claude`, or a scratchpad
never gets POSTed. Both the resolved root and file path are canonicalized
(`cd ... && pwd -P`) before the prefix check, so macOS's `/tmp` →
`/private/tmp` symlink doesn't defeat the filter.

## No-double-coverage rule

The hook's matcher table deliberately **excludes** `decision`/`pr`/`todo`
*mutations* (`create`/`update`/`link`/`transition`/…). The MCP server
already self-emits those events on its own write path (`bus.emit(...)`
inside the service layer) and they already animate today — births, halos,
tombstones, and per-actor attribution pills in
[`live-effects.js`](graph-ui.md#component-boundaries). The hook covers only
what the server can't see from inside a write call: Claude's own **reads**,
file edits, traces, and decision *reads* (`why`/`get` — hence the
`action` gate on the `decision` matcher above). A single tool action animates
via **exactly one** channel — never both.

## Aggregation-point assumption

Each Claude Code session runs its own MCP server process, but only **one**
process binds the shared HTTP port (`CORTEX_VIEWER_PORT`, default `3333`; a
second instance on the same repo skips the viewer bind and continues over
stdio only — see [graph-storage.md](graph-storage.md)). Every session's hook
POSTs to whichever process holds that port — this is precisely how presence
from multiple concurrent sessions (including worktree sessions on the same
project) converges into one viewer tab. If the port owner exits, presence
goes dark until another process binds it; accepted as a v1 limitation.

### Pinning the target (embedding hosts)

An embedding host that runs its own server — Mesh runs one sidecar for every
open workspace — should set `CORTEX_PRESENCE_URL`, which the hook uses as-is
with no probing. Without it the hook falls back to probing `3333`/`3334`, and
since acceptance became registry membership a beacon reaching an unrelated
viewer would now be accepted there rather than rejected. Pinned, a beacon
reaches that host's viewer or nowhere: server down means presence goes dark,
never that it goes somewhere else.

### Port discovery + sentinel

The hook resolves a base URL in this order, per invocation:

1. `CORTEX_PRESENCE_URL` env override, if set — used as-is, no probing.
2. A cached port from the session's sentinel file at
   `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/cortex-presence-port-<session_id>` — written the first
   time a probe succeeds, so subsequent hook invocations in the same session
   skip the probe entirely.
3. Otherwise, probe `CORTEX_VIEWER_PORT` (if set), then `3333`, then `3334`
   (plugin default vs. `npm run dev`) — each via `GET /api/health` with a
   0.3 s timeout, first responder wins, and the winning port is written to
   the sentinel.

If a POST to a cached port fails, the sentinel is cleared so the next
invocation re-probes rather than retrying a dead port forever.

### Auth + opt-out

`CORTEX_API_TOKEN`, if set, is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (the
POST honors the same bearer-auth gate as every other `/api/*` route — see
[http-api-contract.md](http-api-contract.md)). `CORTEX_PRESENCE=0` disables
the hook entirely (checked first, before even the `jq` presence check).

## Retention

| Layer | Window | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Server event log | 24 h (`PRESENCE_RETENTION_MS` = `86_400_000` ms) | `EventPersister.reapPresence()`, run once at worker `init` — deletes rows where `kind LIKE 'presence.%' OR kind LIKE 'show.%'` (so `show.focus` **and** `show.advance` events share this sweep; the `stories`/`story_steps`/`story_links` **records** are untouched — only the *event-log* rows for `advance` pushes are reaped, not the durable story) |
| Viewer backfill replay | 30 min (`BACKFILL_WINDOW_MS` = `1_800_000` ms in `CanvasHost.tsx`) | Backfilled (`live:false`) events older than the window are dropped before reaching `engine.applyPresence` — live events are never window-filtered |

The two windows serve different jobs: the server retains a day of raw
presence rows so any tab that connects within 24 h has *something* to
backfill from, while the viewer only *animates* the last 30 minutes of that
backfill — older beacons are inert history the server will eventually reap,
not something a freshly-opened tab replays as if it just happened.

## Viewer

### `canvas/presence.js` — pure state machine

`createPresence({ reducedMotion })` (`src/viewer/canvas/presence.js`) is a
pure, injectable-time state machine in the same style as `live-effects.js`:
no canvas access, no `Math.random`, self-cleaning via `now`-relative
queries. The engine feeds it BFS paths over the frame adjacency graph (it
never sees the frame graph itself) and reads back per-frame heat / per-
session roster / travel state every draw.

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PRESENCE_HEAT_MS` | 90,000 (90 s) | Linear decay window for the faint **TRAIL** heat tier |
| `PRESENCE_FLASH_MS` | 6,000 (6 s) | Linear decay window for the prominent **FLASH** heat tier (arrival glow) |
| `COLOR_FADE_MS` | 3,500 (3.5 s) | Cursor `colorAmount` fade after arrival — a resting cursor cools from its hue to neutral ink (prototype v5) |
| `IDLE_MS` | 120,000 (2 min) | No events past this age → session drawn dimmed ("idle") but still present |
| `GONE_MS` | 900,000 (15 min) | No events past this age → session dropped from every query (roster, sessions, heat) |
| `TRAVERSE_SEG_MS` | 580 ms | Per-segment eased traversal duration when an avatar moves frame-to-frame |
| `HEAT_BY_ACTIVITY` | `edited:1.0, studied:0.6, traced:0.6, consulted:0.4` | TRAIL contribution per activity kind, capped at 1.0 total |
| `PRESENCE_COLORS` | 6 RGB triples (amber, blue, purple, emerald, rose, teal) | Deterministic per-session color via `colorIdxFor(sessionId)` (base-31 polynomial hash of `sessionId`, mod 6) — first three mirror the prototype's `--agent-a/b/c`; distinct from `LAYER_RGB` and the theme accent |

Grammar, in brief (full prose is in the module's header comment):

- **`noteActivity`** — upserts the session's roster entry, bumps the faint
  **TRAIL** heat on every resolved frame, stores the `targetPath` (the ref
  anchoring the target frame, for the dot-level cursor approach), and sets
  the traversal target to the first resolved frame. No prior position (new
  session), `animate:false` (replayed backfill), or `reducedMotion` →
  teleport directly. Otherwise the target becomes **pending** for the engine
  to resolve into a BFS path via `setPath`.
- **`setPath`** — the engine hands back a frame-to-frame path; the session
  advances it lazily, one `TRAVERSE_SEG_MS` segment at a time inside
  `sessions(now)` (no timers), firing one synapse pulse per segment and one
  **FLASH** per arrival — including catch-up: if two+ segments complete
  between polls, each crossed boundary still gets its own historically-timed
  pulse and flash rather than one merged jump.
- **Idle/gone** — `lastSeen` age past `IDLE_MS` dims the avatar; past
  `GONE_MS` the session is pruned entirely (every query calls `prune(now)`
  first).
- **Heat** — `presenceHeat(frameId, now)` is a deliberately **pure read**
  (no self-delete-on-read, unlike `live-effects.js`'s transient queues):
  heat entries are bounded by distinct frame count (not event volume) and
  must stay a pure function of `(value, t0)`. It returns
  `{ flash, trail, flashColorIdx, trailColorIdx }` (each tier in `[0,1]`) or
  `0` when neither tier is live.
- **Cursor `colorAmount`** — `sessions(now)` reports a per-session
  `colorAmount`: `1` while traversing, then fading to `0` over
  `COLOR_FADE_MS` after arrival, so the engine can lerp a resting cursor's
  color from its hue back to neutral ink (prototype v5 cursor treatment).

### Three heat tiers, kept distinct

Presence heat is **two-tier** — this is what fixes the "wide-border storm"
(too many frames glowing at once because heat was event-time-applied with a
90 s decay). FLASH marks *where a session is now*; TRAIL is the slow *where
work has happened lately* backfill trail.

| Tier | Owner | Decay | Applied on | Draw (max α) | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mutation heat | `live-effects.js`, `HEAT_DECAY_MS = 5500` (5.5 s) | fast, linear | server mutation | uncolored border warmth | "something changed here" |
| Presence FLASH | `canvas/presence.js`, `PRESENCE_FLASH_MS = 6000` (6 s) | fast, linear | **arrival** (live teleport, each traversal-segment arrival, or live re-activity on the current frame) | session-colored **wide border** (0.35) | "a session is HERE now" |
| Presence TRAIL | `canvas/presence.js`, `PRESENCE_HEAT_MS = 90000` (90 s) | slow, linear | **event time**, every resolved frame | session-colored faint outline (0.12) | "work happened here lately" |

Backfill / `reducedMotion` (`animate:false`) applies **TRAIL only, never
FLASH** — so a reload never lights every touched frame's wide border at
once. The engine draws the faint trail **under** the wide flash. All tiers
render simultaneously and independently.

### `adapters.js` helpers

`src/viewer/canvas/adapters.js` provides the pure functions the engine
composes into the presence pipeline:

- **`frameIdsForRefs(pathIndex, refs)`** — resolves a beacon's `refs[]`
  (file paths, `"path::symbol"` qualified names) to frame ids via the
  frame-path index. Decision/todo ids (`/^[DT]-/`) have no frame anchor and
  are skipped; unresolvable paths drop silently. De-duped, order-preserving.
- **`primaryRefPath(pathIndex, refs)`** — the file path of the **first**
  resolving ref (the ref anchoring `frameIdsForRefs(...)[0]`, i.e. the
  traversal target). Carried on the session as `targetPath` so the cursor
  can target that file's actual dot when it's drawn. `null` when nothing
  resolves.
- **`buildFrameAdjacency(pairs)`** — builds an undirected adjacency map from
  inter-frame pairs (the same connectivity the edge web draws), rebuilt on
  every `setData` (project switch).
- **`frameBfsPath(adj, fromId, toId)`** — shortest frame-to-frame path
  (inclusive), `[]` when unreachable or either endpoint is unknown.

### `engine.js` — `applyPresence` / draw / roster

- **`applyPresence(events)`** (public engine method, called from React) —
  for each `{ payload, live }` event: resolves `refs` to frame ids via
  `frameIdsForRefs`, calls `presenceFx.noteActivity({ ..., animate: live !==
  false })`, then — if a traversal target is now pending — computes a BFS
  path via `frameBfsPath` over `FRAME_ADJ` and hands it to `presenceFx.setPath`
  (falling back to a direct 1-hop "path" when no route exists or there's no
  prior position). Inert until events arrive: an empty roster draws nothing.
- **`drawPresence(now)`** — called last from `mainLoop`, gated on the
  `showPresence` layer pref. Draws, in order:
  - **Synapse pulses** — a bright head + fading trail in the moving
    session's hue. When a real inter-frame edge between the two frames is
    **currently drawn** (`drawnInterFrameEdgePx` — both endpoint dots pass
    the same LOD reveal + cull gating `drawNodes` uses), the pulse rides that
    edge's actual endpoint geometry (prototype `drawSynapses`); otherwise it
    runs frame-center to frame-center.
  - **Session cursors** — the prototype v5 cursor: a breathing dot whose
    color lerps from neutral base ink toward the session hue by `colorAmount`
    (fading over `COLOR_FADE_MS` after arrival). At rest the dot targets the
    ref's **actual dot** (`dotPxIfDrawn`) when that dot is drawn at the
    current LOD; during traversal it lerps along the active segment; when the
    dot is shed at low zoom it falls back to the frame center (never a stale
    dot position). `frameCenterPx` / `dotPxIfDrawn` reuse the same
    camera-composed per-tick `framePx` cache and `visibleFrames` culling as
    `drawFrames`, so cursors and heat stay glued under pan/zoom. Each cursor
    also carries the prototype v5 name pill (`drawCursors` 1:1): a fully
    rounded pill 11px right of the dot with the claude ✳ glyph +
    `@workspace`, its fill lerping from neutral `IDLE_GREY` toward the session
    hue by `colorAmount` (cools to a quiet grey pill at rest — it persists, it
    never fades out) and sharing the dot's idle dimming.

  Fully inert (no-op) when the pref is off or the roster is empty.
- **Roster → React** — `scheduleRosterCallback()` throttles
  `onPresenceRoster` to at most once per second, and `emitRosterIfChanged()`
  skips the callback entirely when the JSON-serialized roster hasn't changed
  since the last emission (idle/gone transitions can flip roster content
  without a new event, so the main loop also pokes the schedule each frame).
- **`showPresence` pref** — `SHOW_LS.presence = 'cortex.viewer.show.presence'`
  localStorage key, defaulted **on** (`readShow` treats anything but the
  literal `"0"` as on), toggled via `LmToggle` in `LayersMenu.tsx`
  (`lm-presence` row) and persisted by `App.tsx`'s `layerPrefs` effect —
  same pattern as `showFrames`/`showDecisions`/`showTodos`.

### `PresenceStrip.tsx` — roster UI

`src/viewer/app/toolbar/PresenceStrip.tsx` renders the prototype v5
`.presence` strip — one **28px overlapping avatar ring** per active session
from `useUiStore((s) => s.presenceRoster)` (populated by `CanvasHost`'s
`onPresenceRoster` callback), hidden entirely when `showPresence` is off or
the roster is empty. Each avatar: session hue from a **hand-synced** copy of
`PRESENCE_COLORS` (`COLORS` array, kept in sync by comment since CSS-in-JS
can't import the canvas module), the claude "session" provider glyph (the
prototype's 4-line asterisk), a `border: 2px solid var(--bg)` separation
ring, `-8px` overlap, and an `idle` class that swaps the hue for neutral
grey. Hovering an avatar lifts it (`.lifted`, `translateY(-3px)`) and reveals
a single shared `.presence-tip` showing `@handle` (the workspace) + a
provider line (`claude session · <6-char session id>`) — same light/dark
`var(--*)` token treatment as the prototype. React owns this DOM (house
rule); the canvas presence layer draws cursors/heat, never the strip. Mounted
in `Toolbar.tsx` alongside `LayersMenu`.

### Viewer-side race handling (`CanvasHost.tsx`)

Presence events can arrive over WS before the engine's frame index exists
(HTTP boot hasn't resolved yet). `CanvasHost.tsx` buffers
(`pendingPresence`, capped at `PENDING_PRESENCE_CAP = 400`, drop-oldest on
overflow) until `armFramesReady()` fires — shared by `boot()`, the
`resnapshot` callback, and the project-switch handler — then flushes in
arrival order. A monotonic `loadEpoch` token guards all three async loaders
so a stale in-flight loader (e.g. project A's boot resolving after a switch
to B has started) can't re-arm the gate against the wrong project's frame
index. `ws-client.js`'s `event`/`backfill_page` messages are **not**
filtered by bound project the way `projection` deltas are, so `CanvasHost`
applies its own guard before touching the engine:
`belongsToProject(event, currentProject)`
([`event-routing.ts`](../../src/viewer/app/event-routing.ts)), hoisted to the
top of `onEvent` and covering all three kinds. It compares the event's
`project_id` — the checkout the beacon was accepted for — against the project
on screen, which is the right question now that acceptance is registry
membership and several repos' beacons can coexist. (It replaced an
`isLiveProject()` check, which asked whether the *server* was bound to the
project on screen; that was only ever a working proxy because the old
single-home-repo gate meant one repo's beacons could exist at all.
`isLiveProject` still guards `projection` deltas inside ws-client.)
The predicate is permissive in two cases: an empty `project_id` (events
persisted before the field was stamped, still inside the 24 h retention
window) and a `null` `currentProject` — the window between the WS `hello`
and `fetchProjects()` resolving, where presence is buffered rather than
dropped.

## Focus spotlight (slice 2a)

The `show` tool's one action (`focus`) posts an agent-held **spotlight** to
the viewer. The transport mirrors presence almost exactly — same event bus,
same worker, same WS channel — but spotlight is a **presentation** signal
the agent issues explicitly, not telemetry a hook streams automatically, and
it behaves differently at every layer where that distinction matters.

### Transport (mirrors presence)

```

1. **`show({action:"focus", repo_path, refs?, note?})`**
   ([`show-dispatcher.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/tools/show-dispatcher.ts)) —
   `refs` capped at 50, `note` capped at 2000 chars. Delivers via
   `postToViewer(path, body, env)`
   ([`viewer-post.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/tools/viewer-post.ts)): tries
   `CORTEX_VIEWER_PORT` (env override), then `3333`, then `3334`, deduped;
   `Authorization: Bearer <CORTEX_API_TOKEN>` when set; 800 ms timeout per
   candidate; first 2xx wins. **Never throws** — every failure mode (no
   port answers, non-2xx, timeout) resolves to `{delivered:false,
   accepted:false}`, which the dispatcher turns into the
   `No viewer reachable` result text rather than an MCP error. This is the
   one MCP tool that posts an HTTP body itself — presence's beacons are
   hook-driven `curl`, not an MCP tool call, because presence must stay
   agent-effort-free while spotlight is an explicit agent action.
2. **`POST /api/show-focus`** ([`api.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/api.ts)) —
   validates against `ShowFocusPostSchema`
   ([`api-schemas.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/api-schemas.ts)), the same
   `MAX_PRESENCE_BODY` (16 KB) cap and the same `resolveBeaconTarget`
   registry gate `/api/presence` uses (`src/mcp-server/beacon-target.ts`:
   the checkout axis first, so a linked worktree resolves to its own row and
   its own graph, then `canonicalRepoPath` for a subdir or an unregistered
   worktree), then calls `presence.emitFocus(parsed.data, target)` on accept.
   Response is always `{version, accepted}` — an unregistered repo is
   `accepted:false`, never an error status.
3. **Bus wiring** ([`src/index.ts`](../../src/index.ts) →
   [`show-events.ts`](../../src/events/show-events.ts)) — `emitFocus` wraps
   the POST body into a full `Event` envelope via `showFocusEvent()`
   (`kind: "show.focus"`, `project_id` the resolved registry name, payload
   `{refs, note, repo_path}` with the resolved checkout root) and
   calls `bus.emit(...)` — the same EventBus → worker → WS pipeline every
   other event kind rides (see
   [graph-ui.md](graph-ui.md#event-flow-claude-creates-a-decision)).
4. **Worker** — `deriveMutations()`'s `show.focus` case returns `[]`
   unconditionally: *"Spotlight is presentation, not knowledge."* Zero graph
   mutations, same guarantee as presence.
5. **Retention** — `EventPersister.reapPresence(nowMs)` deletes `events`
   rows where `kind LIKE 'presence.%' OR kind LIKE 'show.%'` older than
   `PRESENCE_RETENTION_MS` (24 h) — one shared reap sweep covers both event
   families; no separate retention path for spotlight.

### Viewer: live-only, held, Esc chain

Where spotlight diverges hardest from presence:

- **Live-only.** `CanvasHost.tsx`'s `onEvent` branches on
  `event.kind === "show.focus"` above the presence branch and returns early
  unless `meta.live === true` — a backfilled (`live:false`) focus event is
  **dropped, never buffered**. A tab that reconnects mid-session does not
  replay a stale spotlight; the agent re-issues `focus` if one should still
  be showing. (Contrast presence, which buffers pre-boot events and replays
  up to 200 backfilled events per reconnect.)
- **Held, not decaying.** `engine.js`'s `applySpotlight(cmd)` stores
  `{ frameSet, decSet, todoSet, t0 }` (or clears to `null`) and the
  spotlight stays exactly as set — no timer, no decay — until: the agent
  posts a new `focus` (replaces it), the agent posts `refs: []` (clears it),
  the user presses Esc, or a project switch/resync wipes it (`setData`
  clears `spotlight` and fires `onSpotlight(null)`; the agent re-issues on
  the new project if still wanted).
- **Dim composes with single-frame focus.** `drawFrames` computes a
  `spotDim` (eased over `FOCUS_DURATION`) for every frame **not** in
  `frameSet`, then takes `Math.max(dimLevel, spotDim)` against the existing
  single-frame `computeFocusProgress` dim — the two dims compose rather than
  one overriding the other.
- **`D-`/`T-` refs ring decision/todo dots**, matched against **both** the
  display id (`D-12`/`T-3`, seq form) and the canonical id
  (`decisionDisplayId(dec)`/`String(dec.id)`) — a ref in either form lights
  the dot. Non-member decision/todo dots recede to `globalAlpha = 0.45`
  (whole-dot: fill, leaders, ring, pill) while a spotlight is active;
  members and the no-spotlight case render at full alpha.
- **Unresolved refs surface verbatim** on the caption card
  (`SpotlightCard.tsx`, bottom-center, mounted in `App.tsx`): `not in
  graph: <ref>, <ref>` for anything `partitionSpotlightRefs`
  (`src/viewer/canvas/adapters.js`) couldn't resolve to a frame, decision,
  or todo — the original ref string (qualifier suffix included) is kept,
  even though frame *resolution* strips `::symbol` before matching.
- **Esc chain.** `App.tsx`'s global `Escape` handler tries, in order,
  **palette → drawer → story → spotlight → frame-focus** — the first open
  layer wins and the rest are left alone. A held spotlight is the fourth
  rung, ahead of clearing the single-frame camera focus.

### Ref forms

The three forms `partitionSpotlightRefs` understands:

| Form | Example | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| Repo-relative path | `src/viewer/canvas/engine.js` | a frame, via the frame-path index |
| `"path::symbol"` qualified name | `src/viewer/canvas/engine.js::applySpotlight` | the path prefix resolves to a frame; the qualifier is stripped for matching but kept verbatim in `unresolved` if it doesn't resolve |
| Decision / TODO id | `D-zwrt`, `T-119` | a decision/todo dot, matched verbatim against either display or canonical id |

### Spotlight vs. presence

| | Presence | Spotlight |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Automatic — every `Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` + a few Cortex read tools, via a `PostToolUse` hook | Explicit — the agent calls `show({action:"focus", ...})` |
| Lifetime | **Decaying** — FLASH (6 s), TRAIL (90 s), idle (2 min), gone (15 min) | **Held** — no decay; lasts until replaced, cleared (`refs: []`), Esc, or a project switch |
| Purpose | **Telemetry** — "work happened here," ambient | **Presentation** — "look here," curated |
| Graph mutation | Zero (`deriveMutations` → `[]`) | Zero (`deriveMutations` → `[]`) |
| Backfill | **Replayed** on reconnect (200-event backfill, 30 min animate window) | **Live-only** — dropped on backfill, never replayed |
| Server retention | 24 h (`PRESENCE_RETENTION_MS`), `kind LIKE 'presence.%'` | 24 h (`PRESENCE_RETENTION_MS`), `kind LIKE 'show.%'` — same reap sweep |
| Viewer surface | Avatar cursors, synapse pulses, frame heat, roster strip | Frame dim, decision/todo dot rings + fade, caption card |
| Esc | Not dismissible via Esc | Fourth rung of the Esc chain (palette → drawer → story → spotlight → frame-focus) |

## Stories (slice 2b)

A **story** is a durable, ordered walkthrough — `title` + `description?` +
an inline array of steps (`caption`, `refs`, `emphasis_edges?`,
`layout_hint?`), each resolved and rendered by the viewer at *read* time,
never baked into a graph node. Where focus is a one-shot, live-only signal,
a story is a record: it survives the chat, survives a reindex, and can be
paged live (`advance`) or opened cold from a link.

### Storage — sidecar tables, S-ids, atomic create

Three new tables in the **same** `~/.cortex/<repoId>/decisions.db` sidecar
that holds decisions and todos (`src/decisions/db.ts`'s `BASE_SCHEMA`) — not
the graph store, so stories are **durable across reindex by construction**,
exactly like decisions/todos:

- **`stories`** — `id` (canonical `S-xxxx`, e.g. `S-9m2x`), `seq` (the
  display-form counter, `S-12`), `title`, `description`, `status`
  (`open` | `closed`), `created_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **`story_steps`** — one row per step, `story_id` + 1-based `step_index` +
  `caption` + `refs` (JSON `string[]`) + `emphasis_edges` (JSON
  `[string,string][]` or `NULL`) + `layout_hint` (`NULL` | `'network'` |
  `'organic'`, slice 3), `ON DELETE CASCADE` off `stories`.
- **`story_links`** — `story_id` → `{target_kind: 'decision'|'pr',
  target_ref, relation: 'ABOUT'}`, the same string-keyed link pattern
  decisions/todos use (survives reindex; PR links key on PR number, not a
  graph node id).

Ids are minted via the shared `mintId(db, "story", existsFn)`
([`src/ids/allocator.ts`](../../src/ids/allocator.ts)) / short-id scheme
([`src/ids/short-id.ts`](../../src/ids/short-id.ts)) — `story` is a third
`EntityType` alongside `decision`/`todo`, prefix `S`. A `story_id` param
accepts either form: the canonical id or the bare/`S-`-prefixed seq
(`parseRef("story", ref)`), same as decision/todo refs.

**`StoryService.create`** ([`src/stories/service.ts`](../../src/stories/service.ts))
wraps the story row + all step rows + all links in a **single
`db.transaction(...)`** — a story is written whole or not at all; there is
no incremental step-building API, so a half-built story can never dangle
mid-creation. `show({action:"story",...})`'s `steps` array is therefore
required and non-empty (`"story requires at least one step"` otherwise) and
capped at 20 steps by the MCP schema (recommended shape is 3–7 — see the
[`show-your-work`](../../skills/show-your-work/SKILL.md) skill).

### Naming deviation: `show.advance`, not `story.advance`

The [design spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-show-your-work-design.md#3-presence-pipeline)
names the live-paging event `story.advance`. **The shipped event kind is
`show.advance`** — a deliberate deviation, for two reasons that both key on
the `show.` prefix rather than `story.`:

1. **Retention reap.** `EventPersister.reapPresence()`
   ([`src/events/worker/persister.ts`](../../src/events/worker/persister.ts))
   already deletes `events` rows matching `kind LIKE 'presence.%' OR kind
   LIKE 'show.%'` — added for `show.focus` in slice 2a. Naming the new kind
   `show.advance` lets it ride that existing sweep for free; `story.advance`
   would need its own `LIKE 'story.%'` clause (and story *records* must
   **never** be reaped — only their transient event-log paging rows — so a
   `story.%` pattern would be one keystroke away from a dangerous typo
   against the durable `stories` table).
2. **Live-only viewer namespace.** The viewer's live-event handling
   (`CanvasHost.tsx`'s `onEvent`) already special-cases `kind ===
   "show.focus"` as live-only, never-backfilled. `show.advance` joins that
   same `show.*` family and the same live-only treatment (a backfilled
   `advance` from 20 minutes ago must not silently re-page a story a user
   is actively reading) — one namespace, one rule, instead of a parallel
   `story.*` family needing its own case.

The MCP-facing **action** name is still `advance` (`show({action:"advance",
...})` — see [the `show` tool reference](../mcp-tools.md#action-advance));
only the internal event `kind` differs from the spec's working name.

### Delivery path

`advance` reuses the exact focus transport
([Focus spotlight](#focus-spotlight-slice-2a) above), swapped to the story
endpoint:

```
show({action:"advance",...})   HTTP                       EventBus            Worker thread         WS                    Viewer
─────────────────────────────   ────                       ───────             ────────────          ──                    ──────
show-dispatcher.ts          POST /api/show-advance   →   bus.emit(        processEvent():       broadcast             CanvasHost.tsx
  StoryService                  │                          show.advance) →  persister.insert()  →  { type:'event',       onEvent →
  .checkAdvance() (pre-flight,  Zod-validated,                              deriveMutations→[]        event }           handleAdvanceEvent()
   throws on missing/closed/    16 KB cap,                                  (zero mutations)            │              (story-controller.ts)
   out-of-range BEFORE POST)    canonical-root gate                                                  live-only:
  postToViewer()                accepted:true/false                                                  dropped if
  (port discovery,                                                                                    !meta.live
   Bearer, 800ms/port,
   never throws)
```

1. **`show({action:"advance", repo_path, story_id, step})`**
   ([`show-dispatcher.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/tools/show-dispatcher.ts)) —
   validates via `StoryService.checkAdvance` (story exists, is `open`,
   `step` in `[1, step_count]`) **before** posting, so a validation failure
   never reaches the network. `step` is capped `[1, 9999]` at the MCP schema
   layer; the real bound is the story's own `step_count`, enforced by
   `checkAdvance`. On a validation pass, delivers via the same
   `postToViewer(path, body, env)`
   ([`viewer-post.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/tools/viewer-post.ts)) focus
   uses — same port discovery, same 800 ms/candidate timeout, same
   never-throws contract. **The story is already durably persisted by this
   point** — `postToViewer` failing (`{delivered:false}`) is reported back
   as `"No viewer reachable — story persists; open it via its viewer_url"`,
   a normal outcome, never a tool error.
2. **`POST /api/show-advance`** ([`api.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/api.ts)) —
   validates against `ShowAdvancePostSchema`
   ([`api-schemas.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/api-schemas.ts): `repo_path`,
   `story_id`, `step` int `[1,9999]`), same `MAX_PRESENCE_BODY` cap and the
   same `resolveBeaconTarget` registry gate every `show`/presence POST route
   shares (`src/mcp-server/beacon-target.ts`: the checkout axis first, so a
   linked worktree resolves to its own row and its own graph, then
   `canonicalRepoPath` for a subdir or an unregistered worktree), then calls
   `presence.emitAdvance(parsed.data, target)` on accept.
3. **Bus wiring** ([`src/index.ts`](../../src/index.ts) →
   [`show-events.ts`](../../src/events/show-events.ts)) — `emitAdvance`
   wraps the POST body into a full `Event` envelope via `showAdvanceEvent()`
   (`kind: "show.advance"`, `project_id` the resolved registry name, payload
   `{story_id, step, repo_path}` with the resolved checkout root) and calls
   `bus.emit(...)` — the same EventBus → worker → WS pipeline every other
   event kind rides.
4. **Worker** — `deriveMutations()`'s `show.advance` case
   (`src/events/worker/mutation-deriver.ts`) returns `[]` unconditionally:
   *"Story paging is presentation, not knowledge."* Zero graph mutations,
   same guarantee as `show.focus`/presence.
5. **Viewer** — `CanvasHost.tsx`'s `onEvent` routes a live (`meta.live ===
   true`) `show.advance` to `story-controller.ts`'s `handleAdvanceEvent(
   story_id, step)` — backfilled `show.advance` events are dropped, same
   live-only rule `show.focus` uses (see the naming-deviation rationale
   above).

### Viewer state machine (`story-controller.ts`)

[`src/viewer/app/story/story-controller.ts`](../../src/viewer/app/story/story-controller.ts)
owns story-mode as one piece of UI state: `{ story: AdaptedStoryDetail, step,
agentStep, following } | null` in `useUiStore`.

- **Entry points — deep link, palette, live advance, never load.**
  `openStory(id, step=1)` fetches via `/api/stories/:id`, clamps `step` into
  `[1, story.stepCount]`, and sets `following: true`. It's called from
  exactly three places — a `?story=S-xxxx` deep link, an explicit "Open
  story…" palette pick, or `handleAdvanceEvent` opening a story that wasn't
  already active — **never** from page load itself. That's the
  **never-auto-open invariant**: opening the viewer after any session
  always shows the normal map; a persisted story waits in the palette until
  someone reaches for it.
- **`pageStory(delta)`** — manual arrow/button paging, clamped to
  `[1, stepCount]`; sets `following = (newStep === agentStep)` — paging
  back *onto* wherever the agent currently is resumes following without a
  separate action.
- **`handleAdvanceEvent(story_id, step)`** — the live-`show.advance`
  entry point, and where **following/agentStep pacing** (the design spec's
  "user wins" rule) lives:
  - Same story already open **and** `following: true` → both `step` and
    `agentStep` jump to the (clamped) new step; the view moves.
  - Same story open **but the user has paged away** (`following: false`) →
    only `agentStep` updates. The **step the user is looking at does not
    move** — the UI instead surfaces a "agent is on step N →" chip
    (`syncToAgent()` jumps to it and re-arms `following: true` on click).
  - No story open, or a *different* story's id → `openStory(story_id,
    step)`, then stamps `agentStep` to the freshly-opened story's clamped
    step — an arriving live narration takes the stage, guarded on identity
    so a 404 (which leaves whatever was open before, possibly a different
    story) can't misattribute `agentStep`.
- **`applyCurrentStep()`** — drives the canvas engine for
  `steps[step - 1]` via `engine.applySpotlight({ refs, note: caption,
  emphasis_edges, fit: true })` — story playback reuses the exact same
  spotlight primitive `focus` uses; a story is spotlight-with-a-timeline,
  not a parallel rendering path.
- **`closeStory()`** — `story: null` + `applySpotlight(null)`; does **not**
  call `show({action:"close",...})` — closing the viewer's local playback
  and closing the *record* (ending its eligibility for further `advance`)
  are independent operations. Because `closeStory()` also clears the
  spotlight, a single Esc at the story rung exits both story mode and any
  held spotlight together.

### `/api/stories` contract

`GET /api/stories` (list, no steps) and `GET /api/stories/:id` (one story +
steps, accepts canonical id or seq) are versioned Zod-enforced routes in
[`api.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/api.ts) /
[`api-schemas.ts`](../../src/mcp-server/api-schemas.ts)
(`StoriesResponseSchema` / `StoryDetailResponseSchema`, wire shape
`AdaptedStory` / `AdaptedStoryDetail`) — both `503` when the server has no
stories repo wired, and both follow the same freshness/ETag/versioning
contract as every other `/api/*` route; see
[http-api-contract.md](http-api-contract.md) for that shared machinery.
`story-controller.ts`'s `fetchStory` (`src/viewer/app/api.ts`) is the sole
viewer-side caller of the detail route.

## What's in scope vs. not (slices 1 + 2a + 2b)

**Shipped, in scope:** the presence pipeline (slice 1) — hook → HTTP → bus →
worker → WS → viewer avatars/traversal/heat/roster strip; the `show` tool's
`focus` spotlight (slice 2a) — MCP tool → HTTP → bus → worker → WS → viewer
dim/rings/caption card; and durable **stories** (slice 2b) — the `show`
tool's `story`/`advance`/`get`/`list`/`close`/`delete` actions, the sidecar
storage, the `/api/stories` routes, and the viewer's story-mode playback —
all described above.

**Explicitly future slices** (see
[the design spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-show-your-work-design.md)):
network layout mode (`network-layout.ts`, dual `pos`/`network_pos`, the
`organic ⇄ network` toggle, `layout_hint: "network"` actually changing
rendering). None of that exists yet — do not build against it.

**Still out of scope** (unchanged from
[graph-ui.md](graph-ui.md#module-layout)'s original non-goal list): the v5
prototype's PR floating nodes, merge animation, auto-loop/demo mode, and
multi-agent simulation. Presence avatars and traversal, formerly on that
same non-goals line, are now shipped — see the amended note in
[graph-ui.md](graph-ui.md#module-layout).
